Static Array:
- Fixed length container indexed from [0, N-1]. N being the total number of elements in the container
- Elements are accessible using indexes (referencable)
Uses:
- Storing and accessing sequential data
- Used by I/o routines as buffers
- Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
- Can be used to return multiple values from a function
- Used in dp to cache answers of subproblems

Search O(N) -> Both dynamic and static Array
Insertion O(N) -> Dynamic Array
Appending O(1) -> Dynamic Array
Deletion O(n) -> Dynamic Array
Access O(1) -> Both 

Dynamic Arrays:
- Can grow and shrink in size
How to implement: 
1) One way is to use a static Array
